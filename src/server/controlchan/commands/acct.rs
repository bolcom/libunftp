//! The RFC 959 Account (`ACCT`) command
//
// The argument field is a Telnet string identifying the user's
// account.  The command is not necessarily related to the USER
// command, as some sites may require an account for login and
// others only for specific access, such as storing files.  In
// the latter case the command may arrive at any time.
//
// There are reply codes to differentiate these cases for the
// automation: when account information is required for login,
// the response to a successful PASSword command is reply code
// 332.  On the other hand, if account information is NOT
// required for login, the reply to a successful PASSword
// command is 230; and if the account information is needed for
// a command issued later in the dialogue, the server should
// return a 332 or 532 reply depending on whether it stores
// (pending receipt of the ACCounT command) or discards the
// command, respectively.
