//! The RFC 959 File Structure (`STRU`) command
//
// The argument is a single Telnet character code specifying
// file structure described in the Section on Data
// Representation and Storage.
//
// The following codes are assigned for structure:
//
// F - File (no record structure)
// R - Record structure
// P - Page structure
//
// The default structure is File.
