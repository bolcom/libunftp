When you need to FTP, but don't want to.

[**Website**](https://unftp.rs) | [**API Docs**](https://docs.rs/libunftp) | [**unFTP
**](https://github.com/bolcom/unFTP)

The libunftp library drives [unFTP](https://github.com/bolcom/unFTP). It's an extensible, async, cloud orientated FTP(S)
server implementation in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) brought to you by the [bol.com techlab](https://techlab.bol.com).

Because of its plug-able authentication (e.g. PAM, JSON File, Generic REST) and storage
backends (e.g. local filesystem, [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)) it's
more flexible than traditional FTP servers and a perfect match for the cloud.

It runs on top of the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) asynchronous run-time and tries to make use of Async IO as much as
possible.

Feature highlights:

* 39 Supported FTP commands (see [commands directory](./src/server/controlchan/commands)) and growing
* Ability to implement own storage back-ends
* Ability to implement own authentication back-ends
* Explicit FTPS (TLS)
* Mutual TLS (Client certificates)
* TLS session resumption
* Prometheus integration
* Structured Logging
* [Proxy Protocol](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy/proxy-protocol/) support
* Automatic session timeouts
* Per user IP allow lists

Known storage back-ends:

* [unftp-sbe-fs](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-sbe-fs) - Stores files on the local filesystem
* [unftp-sbe-gcs](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-sbe-gcs) - Stores files in Google Cloud Storage
* [unftp-sbe-rooter](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-sbe-rooter) - Wraps another storage back-end in order to root a user
  to a specific home directory.
* [unftp-sbe-restrict](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-sbe-rooter) - Wraps another storage back-end in order to restrict
  the FTP operations a user can do i.e. provide authorization.

Known authentication back-ends:

* [unftp-auth-jsonfile](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-auth-jsonfile) - Authenticates against JSON text.
* [unftp-auth-pam](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-auth-pam) - Authenticates
  via [PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM).
* [unftp-auth-rest](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-auth-rest) - Consumes an HTTP API to authenticate.

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 1.41 or higher to build libunftp.

## Getting started

If you've got Rust and cargo installed, create your project with

```sh
cargo new myftp
```

Add the libunftp and tokio crates to your project's dependencies in `Cargo.toml`. Then also choose
a [storage back-end implementation](https://crates.io/search?page=1&per_page=10&q=unftp-sbe) to
add. Here we choose the [file system back-end](https://crates.io/crates/unftp-sbe-fs):

```toml
[dependencies]
libunftp = "0.20.3"
unftp-sbe-fs = "0.2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Now you're ready to develop your server!
Add the following to `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use unftp_sbe_fs::ServerExt;

#[tokio::main]
pub async fn main() {
    let ftp_home = std::env::temp_dir();
    let server = libunftp::Server::with_fs(ftp_home)
        .greeting("Welcome to my FTP server")
        .passive_ports(50000..65535)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:2121").await;
}
```

You can now run your server with `cargo run` and connect to `localhost:2121` with your favourite FTP client e.g.:

```sh
lftp -p 2121 localhost
```

- [unFTP server](https://github.com/bolcom/unFTP), a server from the bol.com techlab that is built on top of libunftp.
