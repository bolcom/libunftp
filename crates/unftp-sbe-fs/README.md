This unftp-sbe-fs crate allows you to use a regular Filesystem with
[libunftp](https://github.com/bolcom/libunftp) and work like a regular
FTP server.

## Getting started

If you've got Rust and cargo installed, create your project with

```sh
cargo new myftp
```

Add the libunftp and tokio crates to your project's dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
libunftp = "0.20.2"
unftp-sbe-fs = "0.2.6"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

Now you're ready to develop your server!
Add the following to `src/main.rs`:

```rust
use unftp_sbe_fs::ServerExt;

#[tokio::main]
pub async fn main() {
    let ftp_home = std::env::temp_dir();
    let server = libunftp::Server::with_fs(ftp_home)
        .greeting("Welcome to my FTP server")
        .passive_ports(50000..65535)
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    server.listen("127.0.0.1:2121").await;
}
```

You can now run your server with `cargo run` and connect to `localhost:2121` with your favourite FTP client e.g.:

```sh
lftp -p 2121 localhost
```
